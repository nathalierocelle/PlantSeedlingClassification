# Plant Seedling Classification

Problem Statement: Build an image classifier which will classify the images of plant seedlings.

Dataset: https://vision.eng.au.dk/?download=/data/WeedData/NonsegmentedV2.zip

The image classifier model is build up using Convolutional Neural Network that can able to classify 12 plant seedling types, 
namely 'Black-grass','Charlock','Cleavers','Common Chickweed','Common wheat','Fat Hen','Loose Silky-bent','Maize',
'Scentless Mayweed','Shepherdâ€™s Purse','Small-flowered Cranesbill'and 'Sugar beet'.

The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics
